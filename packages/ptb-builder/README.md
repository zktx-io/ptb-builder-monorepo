# Programmable Transaction Blocks Builder (PTB Builder)

**PTB Builder** is a visual development tool for **Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs)**, a core technology of the Sui blockchain. Designed to create a powerful synergy with Sui’s PTB capabilities, this tool allows both developers and non-developers to easily construct and manage complex transactions, maximizing the potential of this advanced technology and making it more accessible to a broader audience.

## Key Use Cases

1. Transaction Construction and Pre-Testing:
   - Intuitive UI: Visually construct transactions through a drag-and-drop graphical interface.
   - Code Generation and Review: Verify automatically generated code from the constructed transactions and utilize it for dApp development.
   - Pre-Simulation: Simulate transaction behavior before actual execution to check expected results.
1. Executing Transactions Without Coding:
   - Non-Developer Friendly: Users without coding knowledge can construct and execute transactions, enabling individuals from various fields to utilize blockchain technology.
   - Real-Time Feedback: Provides real-time errors or warnings during transaction construction to help create correct transactions.
1. Saving and Sharing Graphs:
   - Save and Load Files: Save constructed transaction graphs as files and load them when needed.
   - Collaboration Features: Share saved graphs with team members or the community to promote collaboration, allowing transactions to be executed even without a dApp.
1. Transaction Visualization and Verification:
   - Visualization of Execution Results: Visually represent the results of executed programmable transactions for easy understanding.
   - Debugging Support: Provides debugging tools to trace and modify transaction flows when issues arise.

## Main Features

- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Easily construct transactions with a user-friendly interface.
- Automatic Code Generation: Automatically generates Move language code based on the transaction graph.
- Real-Time Error Detection: Instantly notifies errors occurring during construction to help create correct transactions.
- Multi-Language Support: Offers interfaces in various languages for convenient use by users worldwide.
- Extensibility: Expand functionality through plugins or modules, allowing for a customized tool.

## User Benefits

- Enhanced Development Efficiency: Reduce development time by constructing complex transactions quickly and accurately.
- Eased Learning Curve: Create and understand transactions without deep knowledge of the Move language.
- Cost Reduction: Decrease errors during development, reducing costs associated with debugging and fixing.
- Strengthened Collaboration: Promote team collaboration through graph sharing and joint work.

## Roadmap

1. Current Status:
   - Providing PoC Version: Offering an initial version equipped with basic transaction construction and execution features.
   - Collecting User Feedback: Improving the tool by incorporating users’ opinions.
1. Future Plans:
   - VS Code Integration: Plan to integrate PTB Builder into Sui’s VS Code development tool, Sui Extension, allowing developers to create and test transactions in a familiar environment.
   - Adding Advanced Features:
     - Version Control: Enable tracking and restoring changes through version control of transaction graphs.
     - Integrated Testing Environment: Provide a testing environment similar to the actual network to verify transaction behavior more accurately.

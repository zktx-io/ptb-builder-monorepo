## Key Use Cases

1. Transaction Construction and Pre-Testing:
    + Intuitive UI: Visually construct transactions through a drag-and-drop graphical interface.
    + Code Generation and Review: Verify automatically generated code from the constructed transactions and utilize it for dApp development.
    + Pre-Simulation: Simulate transaction behavior before actual execution to check expected results.
1. Executing Transactions Without Coding:
    + Non-Developer Friendly: Users without coding knowledge can construct and execute transactions, enabling individuals from various fields to utilize blockchain technology.
    + Real-Time Feedback: Provides real-time errors or warnings during transaction construction to help create correct transactions.
1. Saving and Sharing Graphs:
    + Save and Load Files: Save constructed transaction graphs as files and load them when needed.
    + Collaboration Features: Share saved graphs with team members or the community to promote collaboration, allowing transactions to be executed even without a dApp.
1. Transaction Visualization and Verification:
    + Visualization of Execution Results: Visually represent the results of executed programmable transactions for easy understanding.
    + Debugging Support: Provides debugging tools to trace and modify transaction flows when issues arise.

## Main Features

+ Drag-and-Drop Interface: Easily construct transactions with a user-friendly interface.
+ Automatic Code Generation: Automatically generates Move language code based on the transaction graph.
+ Real-Time Error Detection: Instantly notifies errors occurring during construction to help create correct transactions.
+ Multi-Language Support: Offers interfaces in various languages for convenient use by users worldwide.
+ Extensibility: Expand functionality through plugins or modules, allowing for a customized tool.

## User Benefits

+ Enhanced Development Efficiency: Reduce development time by constructing complex transactions quickly and accurately.
+ Eased Learning Curve: Create and understand transactions without deep knowledge of the Move language.
+ Cost Reduction: Decrease errors during development, reducing costs associated with debugging and fixing.
+ Strengthened Collaboration: Promote team collaboration through graph sharing and joint work.

## Roadmap

1. Current Status:
    + Providing PoC Version: Offering an initial version equipped with basic transaction construction and execution features.
    + Collecting User Feedback: Improving the tool by incorporating users’ opinions.
1. Future Plans:
    + VS Code Integration: Plan to integrate PTB Builder into Sui’s VS Code development tool, Sui Extension, allowing developers to create and test transactions in a familiar environment.
    + Adding Advanced Features:
        + Version Control: Enable tracking and restoring changes through version control of transaction graphs.
        + Integrated Testing Environment: Provide a testing environment similar to the actual network to verify transaction behavior more accurately.
